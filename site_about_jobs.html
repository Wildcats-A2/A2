            <h2>Job Comparisons</h2>
            <p class="body">
              Jobs across the IT industry range in scope and speciality as it is such a vast arena with continuously changing technologies, knowledge, and client requirements.
              Our group selected jobs which looks to have fit into one of two categories that I will call ‘Back of house’ and ‘Front of house’. Why did we break it down to these two categories?
              Simply because the descriptions and perceived commonalities of each job guided us to.
            </p>
            <img src="site/images/job_comparisons.png">
            <p class="body">
              The listed requirements have been pulled from each job advert supplied. It was then used to inform of a more general requirement which is much simpler than listing every specific language to program. We just wanted to know what jobs required “programming” experience to perform the task as an example.
              Immediately, we can see that engineering, development and systems management roles crossed off more back of house requirements. By going through the requirements in these specific jobs, we can see that they listed significant amounts of programming languages and required an overall jack of all trades understanding of all back-end tech stacks.
            </p>
            <img src="site/images/graph1.png">
            <p class="body">
              When it came to having a broad understanding of technology platforms, all jobs had either stated that to be the case or alluded to it.
              On the front of house side, these were grouped together as more of the client facing, soft skilled jobs. Only two of our jobs really covered soft skills (being able to talk to stakeholders for example), dealing with clients and consultation. It’s obvious these roles are suitable for everyone just as programming isn’t suitable to all people in tech.
            </p>
            <img src="site/images/graph2.png">
            <p class="body">
              The third category was more managerial based in its requirements. This did not necessarily mean defined management roles but was more of the requirement to manage projects, workloads or utilise management philosophies such as AGILE.
            </p>
            <img src="site/images/graph3.png">
            <p class="body">
              We don’t have too much overlap in roles which means the Wildcats could start a business and not step on each other’s toes!
              This could be an interesting point of discussion for our project idea as each member of the team would have a specific speciality in the group such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Brayden would do application development</li>
              <li>Carisse would shop for investors, clients to purchase our offerings</li>
              <li>Daniel would provide the overall template and requirements to execute the offering</li>
              <li>Glenn would administer and maintain the product for the client</li>
              <li>Harmony would develop the front end UI/UX of the project/product</li>
              <li>Xavier would develop and continually feed in data to make our future offerings better and smarter</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <h2>Braydan Shalders - Software Engineer</h2>
            <p class="body">
              My ideal job would be software engineer. Here is a link to a specific job application that I find most suitable to my ideal.
              This position is incredibly appealing to me as it claims to be incredibly hands-on (“80%”), as well as the programing aspect being a major part of the role. What also is appealing to me is the flexibility of the work. It allows for flexible working hours, as well as leaning towards the strengths of the employees.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              The emphasis on being “different” is also quite appealing, the concept of everyone being the same clone of each other isn’t a work environment I’d like to be a part of, having that diversity and individuality is something I am fond of as I believe if we surround ourselves with only people like us, then we cannot truly grow beyond what we are and have no potential for getting better.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              <strong>Skills Required</strong><br>
              The skills and experience required is 5+ years of professional software development, as well as experience with multiple programming languages like Java, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, and other programming languages whether they are front-end, back-end or both.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              Experience in the overall lifecycle of applications from design to deployment is key, as well as the ability to work following the Agile / Scrum framework. Having experience with DevOps Tools such as bitbucket, JIRA and Confluence is also very important. In addition, being able to work with database query languages like SQL as well as databases like Oracle, Postgres and MS SQL is important.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              Out of all the experience required, I only have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of Java and Python (Semi-fluent), very little experience in the lifecycle of applications and very minimal knowledge of databases and SQL / Oracle overall.
