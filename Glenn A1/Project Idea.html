                              The project idea that I am creating will be a website that houses all different aspects of Mechanical Keyboards within Australia. My vision is to create a central hub for all current and new enthusiasts with providing reviews on the most current in stock builds along with builds that people have created. This will consist of an e-commerce store that houses different products from creators across the world that will be housed within Australia making the website a vendor. Along with this, a forum will be attached to allow for members to discuss about what is coming up and ask for questions that newcomers may have heading into this hobby.

                            <h3>Motivation</h3>
                            <p>
                            Currently my motivation for this is that there are too many websites and too little Australian based forum discussions within this hobby. The two that I currently use are the Australian Mechanical Keyboard (AUMK) on Facebook and r/MechanicalKeyboards or r/mechmarket on Reddit. These two are very good at doing what they’re doing with displaying different builds, interest checks, sales and questions for the community. However, my previous experience with just having everything all centralised along with including an e-commerce site for members to purchase could make things easier overall. Geekhack is a very common one that is used at the moment that houses uses users all around the world, creating this will just centralise everything specifically to the Australian market.

A bit further into how this website is going to be utilised will be split up into different sections of the website and I will provide a deeper breakdown.
<br><br>
The Home Page will consist of a few different things, but not too much that it’ll crowd it as this will only serve as the gateway to the different sections. It’ll display the current top sellers/in stock products that the website has recently received. This will allow users to see the latest product in stock that they might have been waiting for. It’ll also display a build of the month pushed by community members to display the different ideas to newer members that arrive through.
<br><br>
Store <br>
This will be housing all the product that is within the warehouse. The aim is try to get as many vendors internationally to Australia to deliver the quickest to our consumers within the country. It’ll be sectioned off with by categories like full DIY Kits, PCB, Case, Lube, Accessories. Further it’ll have a filter section that allows for users to filter by brand and price as well.
<br><br>
Forum <br>
The forum is where all of the discussion along with tutorials will be posted by ourselves running the website amongst other users as well. We’ll be separating it by sections following Introduction, Tutorials, Interest Checks, Market, Build Q&A, Build Discussions. Introductions will be a place where members are able to introduce themselves and how they’ve gotten into the hobby. This will help the users get themselves more deeply rooted into the community and feel like they’re welcomed. Tutorials will be a section where members are able to watch and read instructions/tutorials to deal with anything they’re wanting to do. This will include a whole video and written guide on how to build a keyboard, an explanation of the basics and what will be required. Interest Checks will be a place where users or vendors post their current development or gathering interest to see whether users are liking the products they’re making. This will be for the sole purpose for people to be creative and place forth their ideas so they know if it’ll be suited for the market and be ready to place on order. Market, this will be where people are able to place their products that they no longer want, this will be different from the store as this will be where the users are able to set their prices out. Payments will have to be sorted through a service where we’re able to provide as much help if the end user was to get scammed. Build Q&A, any questions that specifically users need that isn’t outline within the tutorials can be asked here. Opinions from a variety of users can help one make a more informed decision about their purchase prior. Build Discussions, this will be a place where users are able to post their photos of their current builds, display their uniqueness or to get an insight for a future theme/build to inspire others. People in this hobby can be very creative and do a lot of different things, so having this space can allow for users to interact a lot more.

                            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                            <p>
Some of the things that we’ll need to get this running would be a cloud-based web-hosting service. This will allow us to develop and update the website on a consistent basis through cloud, having a local storage system wouldn’t be much of a benefit as any modifications would have to be done locally. Through that we’ll need an e-commerce payment system to house our products and have a seamless payment system. Shopify will be our go to as it is well used throughout the internet along with its easy process to implement into the website.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                            <p>
The skills required to help run this project would be the following:
<li>HTML coding to run/adjust anything that needs to be changed on the website </li>
<li>Shopify API, this is to help implement and create ticket issues to their support team to leave as little downtime with our payment system </li>
<li>Being able to navigate and upload versions to the cloud-based web-host to keep the website most up to date </li>
These would be the bare minimum to open and run this website. These would be very barebone skills that can be taught and progressively learned overtime
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                            <p>
For this project to be successful, the impact that this could have would be filling in a niche in this market at this moment. There are currently a lot of vendors and websites that have this all of these features, however none of them focus specifically within Australia. To have something more Australian based and focus would allow users to not only filter out the international users, but to have a tighter knit community where members could possibly develop long term relationships. Having another vendor dedicated to housing more ready to build kits and accessories within Australia is always handy, for me the aim is to have the most common things in stock all the time. This will include a variety of DIY kits, PCB’s and lube for members to restock at any point without any wait.
