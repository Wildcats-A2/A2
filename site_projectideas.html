        <!-- <article>
          <h2 style="color: slategray">*** TITLE PLZ ***</h2>
        </article> -->

        <article>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <em><strong>“The lifelong journey begins here with ****insert project name***” </strong></em>
          </p>
          <p class="body">This web application (web app) is designed for those who have never played Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) before and would like to begin as a player. Whether you’ve watched games, heard about it through your friends, or would like to give D&D a shot, this web app is the perfect place to start as it will guide you through character creation and initial gameplay. </p>
          <p class="body"><strong>Never played before?</strong></p>
          <p class="body">If you’ve never played D&D before, we will discuss how the application will be used and how it will help a newcomer into the world of D&D. Generally, one person will be the Dungeon Master (DM), they run the games and enforce the rules (the Dungeon Master does a lot more however this is not important for new players).</p>
          <p class="body">The Dungeon Master creates the details and challenges whilst maintaining continuity of events relevant to players whilst you, the newcomer will get to play as a character and enjoy the ride.</p>
          <p class="body">We know that it’s intimidating when you first start learning a new game, there's a whole book dedicated to just being a player (Player's Handbook. 5th Edition)! However, from our experience the best way to learn is by playing. You don’t need to memorise the whole book, just the basics, and if you memorise your character sheet, that’s amazing (some “experienced” players don’t even do that as there is a lot of content)!</p>
          <p class="body">The aim is to get new players familiar with the character creation process and character sheets. It will be recommended that users create a character, as it is easier to remember choices you’ve made rather than trying to remember something you’ve read.  </p>
          <p class="body"><strong>Web Application Flow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The web app will begin on the character creation page. </li>
            <li>The user will be guided through the character creation process (Scrolling down, Single Page Application). </li>
            <li>After saving a character, the site will generate a character sheet based on the users choices. </li>
            <li>The generated character sheet will appear in the “tutorial/training” page. </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="body">On this page, there will be a tutorial users can choose to run through or skip. After the tutorial, players can click on items/attributes displayed on the character sheet. Once clicked, a pop-up will be shown describing: what the item/attribute is, an example of how it is used and the output (if any) and how the output is calculated. Users are encouraged to go “wild” on this page, as it is just a training page and nothing will be saved or altered. </p>
          <p class="body">With some pre-requisite understanding of the game, you will be able to enjoy the game with your friends and fellow D&D enthusiasts without feeling out of place. </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p class="body">D&D is an in-depth game that requires effort and commitment. Creating a character you understand, like and want to play as takes time. If it's your first time playing there is a lot to take in, and you don’t really have an idea on who you want to play as or what you can play as. The amount of content out there is overwhelming, and it can be discouraging to new players. Not only do they have to learn how to play the game, they also have to read a lot of “relevant” content. We can see why a lot of people give up and lose interest. </p>
          <p class="body">Or, maybe you’re teaching someone to play and you end up talking for ages, going on tangents about other races/classes/abilities/etc, and overloading them with new information. While it might seem important at the time, the newbie is probably already overwhelmed. </p>
          <p class="body">I (Harmony) remember when I first started playing (with a group of new players too). We had many questions, most of which were pretty basic but as new players we had no clue what was going on. Some of these questions we had include:              
          <ul>
            <li>What are these sections and why are they sectioned off? </li>
            <li>What’s a saving throw vs ability check etc. </li>
            <li>What’s a 1d8? Which one is the d20 again?  </li>
            <li>How many d6’s do I roll for sneak attack?  </li>
            <li><em>We would always ask our DM what we had to roll, and if we needed to add anything</em></li>
          </ul>      
        </p>
          <p class="body">Some of these questions are intuitive, while others may not be. Ultimately, everyone is different. Some people who have played video games before can work out aspects of the game whilst others have no clue what is going on. Both are fine, unfortunately depending on the character you're playing, you can’t just look to the person next to you for guidance.   </p>

          </ul>

          <p class="body" style="color: mediumspringgreen;"><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
          <p class="body">Where all the FAQs will be, some might include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AC? DC?   </li>
            <li>How do I hit / save / use a skill?   </li>
            <li>How do I deal damage?    </li>
            <li>Spells? Spell Slots?    </li>
            <li>Am I Proficient? What is Proficiency?    </li>
            <li>What can I do on my turn?    </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="body" style="color: mediumspringgreen;"><strong>Tutorial / Training Mod</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>In this mode you will choose either a character sheet you’ve made or use examples given 
              <ul><li>(Advanced) Scripted tutorial that prompts players to roll for different skills, while explaining how outcomes are reached. More or less a test run for the player so they can get a feel of how it works. </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Or users have been directed here after character creation  </li>
            <li>The tutorial will guide players through the character sheet, giving a brief overview on what is section is and examples of how they’re incorporated into game play </li>
            <li>The training page is designed for users to just play with the character sheet, get to know it. What each “thing” does and are provided with examples to give them ideas on how it could be used in the game.  </li>
            <li>The output will be shown as what you would normally expect when playing but will also come with a little explanation   
              <ul>
                <strong>Example: player clicks on “Deception” </strong>
                <li>(Output will be consistent to the current character sheet used)  </li>
                <li>Will show how it got there:   </li>
                <li>1d20 + cha + and prof if proficient   </li>
                <li>14 + 2 + 2 = 18   </li>
                <li><em>So you’re lying? Or maybe you're not telling the whole truth. Whatever you're trying to do your DM has asked to roll Deception.   </em></li>
                <li>“We have your dog hostage. If you don’t give us what we need….”  </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <strong>Example: player clicks on “Skills”  </strong>
              <li>Skills are skills. What is your character good (proficient) at?.... </li>
            </ul>
            <li>A section just for combat and what to expect  
              <ul>
                <li>Initiative  </li>
                <li>What can you do on your turn  </li>
                <li>Etc...</li>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p class="body">Hopefully, we will get more people playing D&D, having fun and making memories. The limited yet sufficient amount of content provided makes the character creation easier and more simplified, so we can get to playing as quickly as possible (however, the option to homebrew certain content will still be available for players to customise and “flavour” a character they want to play).</p>
          <p class="body">The tutorial and training page will hopefully familiarise new players with what to expect and suggest ways in which they could go about things, thus lowering the initial learning curve of the game. From there, once players are comfortable and used to gameplay, they can move onto other applications and websites with more advanced features and content.</p>
          <p class="body">To sum it up, the web application will streamline the character creation process, whilst still having the option for customisation. The tutorial and training page will break down the mechanics of the character sheet and combat, so it is easier for a player to understand and remember the core “rules” of the game.</p>
